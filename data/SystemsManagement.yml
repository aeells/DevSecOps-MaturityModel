Patching:

  Patch policy:
    risk: Recognised security flaws for which there are patch fixes released are not addressed in a controlled fashioon.
    measure: Patch policy for all levels of the system (application, OS, 3rd party dependencies etc) is published and implemented with ability to determine the size of the gap
      between intent and implementation.

    dependsOn:
      - Coverage and control metrics

  Regular build of images:
    risk: Vulnerabilities in running containers or images are retained for too long and expose the risk of exploitation.
    measure: Images and containers are being rebuilt at least nightly.

  Maximum image/container lifetimes:
    risk: Vulnerabilities in running containers or images are retained for too long and expose the risk of exploitation.
    measure: The nightly build images are deployed minimum every 30 days.

  Short maximum image/container lifetimes:
    risk: Vulnerabilities in running containers or images are retained for too long and expose the risk of exploitation.
    measure: The nightly build images are deployed minimum daily.

  Segmentated networks for virtual environments:
    risk: Virtual environments in default settings are able to access other virtual
      environments on the network stack. By using virtual machines, it is often possible
      to connect to other virtual machines. By using docker, one bridge is used by
      default so that all containers on one host can communicate with each other.

  Infrastructure as Code:
    risk: No tracking of changes in systems might lead to errors in the configuration.
      In additions, it might lead to unauthorized changes. An examples is jenkins.
    measure: Systems are setup by code. A full enviorement can be provisioned. In
      addition, software like Jenkins 2 can be setup and configured in in code too.
      The code should be stored in a version control system.

  Production near environments are used by developers:
    risk: In case an errors occurs in production, the developer need to be able to
      create a production near environment on a local development environment.
    measure: Usage of infrastructure as code helps to create a production near environment.
      The developer needs to be trained in order to setup a local develipment environment.
      In addition, it should be possible to create production like test data. Often
      peronal identifiable information is anonymised in order to comply with data
      protection laws.

      to authorized users.

  Usage of a chaos monkey:
    risk: Due to manuel changes on a system, they are not replaceable anymore. In
      case of a crash it might happen that a planned redudant system is unavailable.
      In addation, it is hard to replay manual changes.

  Usage of security by default for components:
    risk: Components (images, libraries, applications) are not hardened.
    measure: Hardening of components is important, specially for image on which other
      teams base on. Hardening should be performed on the operation system and on
      the services inside (e.g. Nginx or a Java-Application).

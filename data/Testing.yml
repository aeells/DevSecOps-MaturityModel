Dynamic application analysis:

  Web application DCA:
    risk: Insufficient security tests are performed and simple vulnerabilities are not detected. For example, missing security configurations in the form of HTTP headers might
      not have been set by Developers. Fast feedback on this ommission is not received.
    measure: A simple web application scan is performed to get a security baseline. This should be automated into the build and deployment process.

  Dynamic code coverage analysis:
    risk: A continuous challenge facing penetration testers is ensuring adequate coverage of a target application. A purely black box perspective makes it almost impossible to
      accurately identify how much of the attack surface was tested for penetration during assessment.

Test Management:

  Reproducible defects:
    risk: To be fixed, vulnerability and security defects must be reproducible in development and test environments. This means these environments must be similiar in
      configuration as the Dev/prod parity principle. Without this, fixes are attempting directly in Production which can lead to an escalation of problems.
    measure: Vulnerabilities include the test procedure to Operations and Development staff the ability to reproduce vulnerabilities in a production-like environment.

  Vulnerability management system:
    risk: Testing, capturing, documenting, visualising and tracking of security vulernabilities is a complex and time-consuming effort, particularly in large, distributed
    Enterprise organisations. Efforts should be made to streamline this so that the barrier to managing security concerns is not too high.
